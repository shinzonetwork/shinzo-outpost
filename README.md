c# Shinzo Outpost ‚Äì Payment Gateway

The Outpost contract is a payment gateway for the Shinzo Network. It enables smart contracts and users to make logic-driven payments tied to digital identities and access control policies. Outposts are deployed on the networks they serve, powering Shinzo‚Äôs decentralized indexing economy through trustless, verifiable payments.

## ‚ú® Features

Accepts and records payments from users.

Associates payments with a Digital ID (unique per user).

Links each payment to an Access Control Policy (ACP).

Supports payment expiration and allows expired payments to be updated.

Exposes queries for inspecting user payments and policies.

## üìñ Core Concepts

Digital ID
A unique identifier for a user that stores their address, identity string, and associated policies.

Access Control Policy (ACP)
Represents the link between a user and the resources/services they can access, tied to a payment.

Payment
Tracks the amount, timestamp, expiration, and whether the payment has expired.

## üîë Contract Overview
Errors

PaymentAmountTooLow(uint256 amount) ‚Äì Reverts if no ETH was sent.

PolicyIdDoesNotExist(string policyId) ‚Äì Reverts if policy ID is empty.

DigitalIdDoesNotExist(string identity) ‚Äì Reverts if identity is empty.

PaymentAlreadyExpired() ‚Äì Reverts if attempting to expire an already expired payment.

PaymentNotExpired() ‚Äì Reverts if attempting to expire before expiration.

### Events

PaymentCreated(address user, string policyId, uint256 paymentIndex)

PaymentExpired(address user, uint256 paymentIndex)

### Key Functions

Function	Description
payment(string policyId, string identity, uint256 expiration)	Accepts a payment, links it to a user‚Äôs Digital ID and policy, stores details, and returns the payment index.
expirePayment(address user, uint256 paymentIndex)	Marks a payment as expired after its expiration time.
getPayment(address user, uint256 index)	Returns a specific payment.
getPaymentAmount(address user, uint256 index)	Returns the amount of a specific payment.
getPaymentCount(address user)	Returns the total number of payments for a user.
getDigitalId(address user)	Returns the Digital ID details for a user.
getPayments(address user)	Returns all payments associated with a user.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development (Foundry)

### Prerequisites

[Foundry](#foundry)

Node.js & Yarn/NPM (for scripts & tooling if needed)

Install & Build
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/shinzonetwork/shinzo-outpost.git
cd shinzo-outpost

# Install dependencies
forge install

# Build contracts
forge build

Run Tests
forge test -vv

Deploy (example)
forge script script/DeployOutpost.s.sol:DeployOutpost \
  --rpc-url $RPC_URL \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY \
  --broadcast

### üîí Security Notes

Payments are stored on-chain and immutable except for expiration status.

Ensure correct expiration values when calling payment().

This contract is unaudited and should not be used in production without review.


### Foundry

[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
